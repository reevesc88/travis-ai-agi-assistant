A field service scheduling and business management app for service companies — pest control, HVAC, plumbing, cleaning, landscaping, and more. Part of the [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) ecosystem. Zero cloud dependencies — runs locally with SQLite.

Built with **Preact + Hono + SQLite**. Ships with a clean dashboard UI, weekly calendar view, job management, customer database, invoicing, materials tracking, and technician dispatch.

## What Is It?

Open Field Scheduling is a production-ready field service management platform designed for the OpenClaw community. Think of it as an open-source alternative to **PestPac**, **ServiceTitan**, **FieldWork**, **Jobber**, or **Housecall Pro** — a complete scheduling and dispatch system you can self-host, customize, and embed in any SaaS product.

Unlike PestPac or ServiceTitan, this runs entirely on your own infrastructure. No per-user fees, no contracts, no vendor lock-in. Manage your entire field service operation from scheduling to invoicing.

## Built for Every Field Service Vertical

Open Field Scheduling is **vertical-agnostic** — configure service types, pricing, and workflows for any industry:

| **HVAC** | AC repair, furnace installation, duct cleaning, maintenance plans, emergency service |
| **Plumbing** | Drain cleaning, pipe repair, water heater installation, sewer inspection, leak detection |
| **Cleaning** | House cleaning, deep clean, move-in/move-out, carpet cleaning, window washing |
| **Landscaping** | Lawn mowing, tree trimming, irrigation, hardscaping, seasonal cleanup |
| **Electrical** | Panel upgrade, outlet installation, lighting, ceiling fan, troubleshooting |
| **Pool Service** | Weekly maintenance, equipment repair, opening/closing, acid wash, leak repair |

## Features

- **Technician dispatch** — assign techs to jobs, track active workloads, toggle availability
- **Service type catalog** — configurable services with default pricing and durations per vertical
- **Invoicing** — generate invoices from completed jobs, track draft/sent/paid/overdue status, line item details
- **Materials tracking** — log materials used on each job with costs, maintain inventory
- **Job checklists** — inspection forms and task lists per job with check/uncheck
- **Activity log** — timestamped notes on every job for internal communication
- **Dashboard** — at-a-glance KPIs: today's schedule, upcoming jobs, revenue, outstanding invoices
- **Search & filter** — find jobs by status, search customers by name/phone/address
- **URL routing** — bookmarkable pages (`/jobs`, `/customers/123`, `/invoices`, `/schedule`)
- **Dual-mode UI** — human-optimized + AI-agent-optimized (`?agent`)

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clawnify/open-fieldservice.git
cd open-fieldservice
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5174` in your browser. Data persists in `data.db`.

### Agent Mode (for OpenClaw / Claude Code)

Append `?agent` to the URL:

```
http://localhost:5174/?agent
```

This activates an agent-friendly UI with:
- Explicit delete/action buttons always visible (no hover-to-reveal)
- Large click targets for reliable browser automation
- All controls accessible without drag interactions

### Using with Claude Code

Claude Code can interact with the scheduler through the REST API:

```bash
# Create a customer
curl -X POST http://localhost:3004/api/customers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "John Smith", "phone": "(555) 123-4567", "address": "123 Main St", "city": "Austin", "state": "TX"}'

# Schedule a job
curl -X POST http://localhost:3004/api/jobs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"customer_id": 1, "service_type_id": 1, "technician_id": 1, "scheduled_date": "2025-01-15", "scheduled_time": "09:00"}'

# Generate an invoice from a completed job
curl -X POST http://localhost:3004/api/jobs/1/invoice
```
